- This is not like a flashcard program where spaced repitition makes
  sense. At least not at the level of which "question" to ask when the
  form is to identify the right answer out of a static set of choices
  because if the odds of a question being asked is a function of how
  often you get it wrong then you start trying to guess about the
  probability. Better to make each choice equally likely. (This is
  mildly annoying when you end up with long runs without any of a
  given question being asked.)

- Weighting may possibly be useful for variants of questions that
  don't affect the answer. For example, in a chord identification game
  where the task is to identify just the basic chord type different
  voicings are variants and it might be useful to weight which
  variants are used to keep things challenging--start with simple
  voicings and then add in more complex voicings and weight which
  voicing is used based on how often questions using that voicing are
  correctly identified.
