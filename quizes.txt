# Simple quizes

## eartraining/quizes/solfege.py

Identify degrees of major scale in a single key.

## eartraining/quizes/chords.py

Identify basic triads and seventh chords in first inversion in a single key.

## eartraining/quizes/intervals.py

Melodic intervals derived from notes of a major scale. (Gets all
possible intervals but not every possible pairing of notes from the
chromatic scale.)

## eartraining/quizes/progressions.py

Identify chord progressions in a single key. Takes some pains to
randomly revoice chords so you can't just listen to the bass note or
something.

# Progressive quizes

From a set of possible questions (e.g. chord types) start with two and
add new questions only after have answered existing ones correctly
often enough. Uses simple +/- scoring rather than anything more
complicated. Does not try to weight which questions get asked.

## eartraining/quizes/progressive.py

Currently a test of all the chord types in eartraining.music.chord_types
