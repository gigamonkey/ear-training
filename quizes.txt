# Simple quizes

## eartraining/quizes/solfege.py

Identify degrees of major scale in a single key.

## eartraining/quizes/chords.py

Identify basic triads and seventh chords in first inversion in a single key.

## eartraining/quizes/intervals.py

Melodic intervals derived from notes of a major scale. (Gets all
possible intervals but not every possible pairing of notes from the
chromatic scale.)

## eartraining/quizes/progressions.py

Identify chord progressions in a single key. Takes some pains to
randomly revoice chords so you can't just listen to the bass note or
something.

# Progressive quizes

From a set of possible questions (e.g. chord types) start with two and
add new questions only after have answered existing ones correctly
often enough. Uses simple +/- scoring rather than anything more
complicated. Does not try to weight which questions get asked.

## eartraining/quizes/progressive.py

Currently a test of all the chord types in eartraining.music.chord_types

# Question scheduling quizes

Uses eartraining.scheduler to keep track of how user is doing on each
question and adds in new questions as needed.

## eartraining/quizes/new_intervals.py

All melodic intervals using weighted question scheduler.

## eartraining/quizes/new_new_chords.py

Chord quiz using weighted question scheduler of questions added in
sets of roots going around the cycle of fourths and different octaves.

# Dimension based quizes.

Uses eartraining.dimensions to bring new variant questions into the mix.

## eartraining/quizes/new_chords.py

Test of many chords using dimensions of types, roots, and octaves.

# eartraining/quizes/new_new_intervals.py

Melodic intervals using dimensions of steps, roots,
ascending/descending, and octaves.
